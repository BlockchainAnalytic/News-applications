Top news websites and applications

The Google News app (formerly known as Play Newsstand) is known for providing relevant content in a newsfeed using A.I.
The "For You" tab shows important and relevant headlines and news developments at the same time (personalized news lists depend on your activity on Google platforms).
“Full coverage” of this smart Android News app displays the same news story reported by all publishers, highlighting all perspectives. However, Google's instinctive approach to providing breaking news sometimes makes it nearly impossible for consumers to follow certain news sources.

4. **Microsoft News**
Formerly known as MSN News, the Microsoft News app for Android provides a smoother experience and helps you navigate effectively through its structured design app.
Under the Settings tab, you have the option to choose from the News Edition of different countries. Take care of sponsored ads so the layout makes it very difficult to distinguish between an organic news story and a sponsored one.
Why Use Microsoft?
* Interest on all platforms
* Night Mode
* Smooth and seamless transitions.
5. **BBC News**
The BBC News Channel is known for displaying unbiased and groundbreaking news, so the BBC app is the best-unbiased news app for the Android platform.
The news app shows the latest reports from each country in one tap. The News Feed section comes in a variety of layout options and also expands the live news channel within the app. You can also change the notification settings and turn off the background sync.
This is one of the few Android news apps that give the app control over shared data, that is, you can turn off "sharing statistics" if you don't want personalized results. The UX design, which lacks smooth animations and interactivity, is the only thing that can hurt you a bit.
Why Use BBC News?
* Best unbiased news app on the entire store
* Different layout settings
* Permissions to use your data
